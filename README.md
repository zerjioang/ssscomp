### Secret Sharing

#### Description

The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integers mod p when p is a prime number. 

#### Packed sharing
If many secrets are to be secret shared, it may be beneficial to use the packed scheme where several secrets are packed into each share. While still very computational efficient, one downside is that the parameters are somewhat restricted.

Specifically, the parameters are split in *scheme parameters* and *implementation parameters*:
- the former, like in Shamir sharing, determines the abstract properties of the scheme, yet now also with a `secret_count` specifying how many secrets are to be packed into each share; the reconstruction limit is implicitly defined as `secret_count + threshold + 1`
- the latter is related to the implementation (currently based on the Fast Fourier Transform) and requires not only a `prime` specifying the field, but also two principal roots of unity within that field, which must be respectively a power of 2 and a power of 3

Due to this increased complexity, providing helper functions for finding suitable parameters are in progress. For now, a few fixed fields are included in the `packed` module as illustrated in the example below:

- `PSS_4_8_3`, `PSS_4_26_3`, `PSS_155_728_100`, `PSS_155_19682_100`

with format `PSS_T_N_D` for sharing `D` secrets into `N` shares with a threshold of `T`.

#### Homomorphic properties

Both the Shamir and the packed scheme enjoy certain homomorphic properties: shared secrets can be transformed by manipulating the shares. Both addition and multiplications work, yet notice that the reconstruction limit in the case of multiplication goes up by a factor of two for each application.
