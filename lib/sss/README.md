# Secret Sharing Schema

>  The main problem with known secret-sharing schemes is the large share size: it is exponential in the number of parties

## Introduction

Secret-sharing schemes are a tool used in many cryptographic protocols. A secret-sharing scheme involves a dealer who has a secret, a set of `n` parties, and a collection `A` of subsets of parties called the access structure.

Originally motivated by the problem of secure information storage, secret-sharing schemes have found numerous other applications in cryptography and distributed computing, e.g., Byzantine agreement, secure multiparty computations, threshold cryptography, access control, attribute-based encryption, and generalized oblivious transfer.
