// fixed a finite field to which all secrets
// and shares belong
// In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field
// (so-named in honor of Ã‰variste Galois) is a field
// that contains a finite number of elements. As with
// any field, a finite field is a set on which the
// operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction
// and division are defined and satisfy certain basic
// rules. The most common examples of finite fields are
// given by the integers mod p when p is a prime number.
