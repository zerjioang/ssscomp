# Linear Regression Tutorial with Boston House Dataset over encrypted data

## TL;DR

This is just a basic example of how Machine Learning Algorithm can work over 'unknown' or 'encrypted' data in order to create **privacy preserving** models

### Boston Housing Dataset

The Boston Housing dataset contains information about various houses in Boston through different parameters.
There are 506 samples and 13 feature variables in this dataset. The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features.
