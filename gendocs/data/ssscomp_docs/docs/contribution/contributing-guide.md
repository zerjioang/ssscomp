# Contributions Welcome!

We welcome contributions to `ssscomp` in many forms, and there’s always plenty to do! First things first, please review the Code of Conduct before participating. It is important that we keep things civil.

## Getting help
If you are looking for something to work on, or need some expert assistance in debugging a problem or working out a fix to an issue, you may ask to community first. The only silly question is the one you don’t ask. Questions are in fact a great way to help improve the project as they highlight where our documentation could be clearer.

## Reporting bugs
If you are a user and you have found a bug, please submit an issue using GITLAB. Before you create a new GITLAB issue, please try to search the existing items to be sure no one else has previously reported it. If it has been previously reported, then you might add a comment that you also are interested in seeing the defect fixed.

If it has not been previously reported, create a new GITLAB issue. Please try to provide sufficient information for someone else to reproduce the issue. One of the project’s maintainers should respond to your issue within 48 hours. If not, please bump the issue with a comment and request that it be reviewed.

## Submitting your fix
If you just submitted a GITLAB issue for a bug you’ve discovered, and would like to provide a fix, we would welcome that gladly! Please assign the GITLAB issue to yourself, then you can submit a change request (CR).

## Fixing issues and working stories

Review the issues list and find something that interests you. You could also check the “help-wanted” list. It is wise to start with something relatively straight forward and achievable, and that no one is already assigned. If no one is assigned, then assign the issue to yourself. Please be considerate and rescind the assignment if you cannot finish in a reasonable time, or add a comment saying that you are still actively working the issue if you need a little more time.

## Reviewing submitted Change Requests (CRs)

Another way to contribute and learn about The Project is to help the maintainers with the review of the CRs that are open. Indeed maintainers have the difficult role of having to review all the CRs that are being submitted and evaluate whether they should be merged or not. You can review the code and/or documentation changes, test the changes, and tell the submitters and maintainers what you think. Once your review and/or test is complete just reply to the CR with your findings, by adding comments and/or voting. A comment saying something like “I tried it on system X and it works” or possibly “I got an error on system X: xxx ” will help the maintainers in their evaluation. As a result, maintainers will be able to process CRs faster and everybody will gain from it.
